PROMPT:

Plan: Create a signin/signup feature for this project and make sure it saves in the database. The link for the database in included in the .env.local file. Once the user has created an account, that is when the user can have access to the system. But these are the steps i want to happen:

Creating an account:
- ask personal information such as name, age, email. etc.
- ask them to create a username and password
- once they have created an account redirect them to the sign in page and they should be able to sign in

Upon signing in:
- user will be asked what genre of movies do they usually love
- user can choose up to 5 genres
- proceed to the main page

Once in the main page it should show the ff:
- The recommended movies based on the users preferred genres 

Other features for having an account:
- The user should be able to add some friends (by username or ign)
- the user can proceed to add some comments to the movies
- the user can proceed to chat in the public chat feature
