PROMPT:
I created a md file and i want you to create a documentation for cursor to follow. So what i want to do is for the FavoritePage to be edited. When you scan the entire code you'd see that in the main page when the user likes a movie it will save in the database and automatically show in the Favorite webpage. However there is no function for the remove from favorites. So that is one thing I want you to include in the FavoritePage.tsx file.

Next, i have this idea where the user can click on the movie card in the favorite page then it will show the full details of the movie. So i'll give a more concise description on what must be done. I have a Movies.tsx component and it contains mostly what should be seen in the homepage which are the most recommended movies. I will be placing here the entire code of both tsx files so you can scan through it and make the documentation more precise and accurate. 

Some of the ideas i want to implement:

1. In the Movies page, once the card is hovered it will show a modal that shows the entire details of the movie. Research more about the fetching of api that is already included in the code
2. In the Favorite page, the user can also see the details of the movie once the movie card is hovered but I also want the user to be able to include some notes in the movie. 
3. The notes section can help them note some quotes from the movie (which should be saved in the database)
4. Upon clicking the movie card it will direct to another page but specific for that movie.
4. Add a comment section for the movies
5. Add a chat system to the project where they can interact with other people and share some reviews with each other and some thoughts as well



üìö Feature Documentation: Movie App Enhancements
Overview
This documentation outlines the enhancements to be implemented in the FavoritePage.tsx and Movies.tsx components of the Movie App. These changes aim to improve user interactivity by adding functionalities such as removing favorites, viewing detailed movie data, adding personal notes, and interacting via comments and chat.

üß© 1. Remove from Favorites
Description
The current FavoritePage displays all movies the user has marked as favorites. However, there is no option to remove a movie from this list.

Implementation Guidelines
Add a functional "Remove from Favorites" button on each movie card in FavoritePage.tsx.

This action should update the favorites state and/or backend to reflect the change immediately.

Use the existing toggleRating or similar function from the Favorites context to handle the removal.

üîç 2. Movie Detail Modal on Hover
Description
In both the Movies page and Favorite page, hovering over a movie card should display a modal with complete details about the movie.

Implementation Guidelines
Create a reusable modal component (e.g., MovieDetailsModal.tsx).

When a card is hovered (or clicked on mobile), display the modal.

Fetch additional movie details from the TMDB API using the movie's ID.

Include data such as title, release date, genres, runtime, and a full overview.

üìù 3. Notes on Favorite Movies
Description
Allow users to attach personal notes (e.g., memorable quotes) to their favorite movies.

Implementation Guidelines
Add a "Notes" section accessible within each favorite movie card or detail modal.

Enable users to add, edit, and delete notes.

Persist notes to a database with fields such as user_id, movie_id, note_content, and timestamp.

Retrieve notes when loading favorite movie details.

üìÑ 4. Dedicated Movie Details Page
Description
Clicking on any movie card in the Favorites or Movies page should redirect users to a dedicated detail page for that movie.

Implementation Guidelines
Create a dynamic route /movie/[id] for full movie details.

Fetch comprehensive data from the TMDB API.

Display extended information including backdrop, genres, runtime, ratings, cast, and trailers.

Integrate the notes and comments section in this page as well.

üí¨ 5. Comment Section per Movie
Description
Users should be able to post public comments about a specific movie, view others' comments, and engage in discussions.

Implementation Guidelines
Add a comments component (e.g., MovieComments.tsx) in the movie detail page.

Users can post new comments, view existing ones, and delete their own.

Store comments with fields like comment_id, user_id, movie_id, comment_text, and created_at.

Optionally sort comments by newest or most liked.

üó®Ô∏è 6. Chat System for User Interaction
Description
Introduce a chat system allowing users to engage in live conversations with others about movies or general topics.

Implementation Guidelines
Implement a chat interface (e.g., ChatRoom.tsx) accessible globally or per movie.

Consider real-time technology such as Firebase Firestore or Socket.io.

Messages should include user_id, message, movie_id (optional), and timestamp.

Include UI for sending, receiving, and viewing messages live.

üîê Considerations
Ensure user authentication is implemented for features like notes, comments, and chat.

Handle API rate limits and errors gracefully.

Optimize performance by lazy-loading modals and detail pages.

Secure all data inputs against XSS or injection attacks.

üß™ Testing
Test the favorite add/remove functionality end-to-end.

Validate that modals appear on hover/click and display accurate data.

Verify data persistence for notes and comments.

Ensure real-time updates in the chat system are consistent and performant.

üì¶ Future Enhancements
Allow tagging or categorizing favorite movies.

Enable private notes and public reviews.

Introduce user profiles with movie stats and preferences.

Add "Watch Later" functionality as a separate list.
